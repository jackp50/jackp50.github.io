                    Hi, I'm <strong>Jack Pearne</strong>, a <strong>Colorado State University graduate</strong> with a 
                    <strong> Bachelor of Science in Business Administration</strong>, specializing in <strong>Computer Information Systems</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my studies, I discovered a passion for <strong>web development</strong>—an interest that quickly became 
                    a full-fledged pursuit. Over the past two years, I've immersed myself in <strong>frontend and backend technologies</strong>, 
                    honing my skills in <strong>React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, API deployment, Node.js, Render, and SQL</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since graduating in <strong>December 2024</strong>, I have been <strong>creating projects 
                    to refine my skills and deepen my expertise</strong>. I thrive on solving challenges, crafting dynamic applications, 
                    and continuously learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm eager to join a <strong>collaborative team</strong> that shares my drive for innovation—building web solutions 
                    that empower users and make a real impact.
                </p>
